INTRODUCTION                                    *packer-introduction*

This is a Neovim plugin manager. It is written in Lua, uses the native
|packages| feature, and has features for declarative plugin configuration
inspired by the `use-package` library from Emacs.

==============================================================================
REQUIREMENTS                                     *packer-intro-requirements*

You need to be running Neovim v0.5.0+; `packer` makes use of extmarks and
other newly-added Neovim features.

==============================================================================

- Declarative plugin specification
- Support for dependencies
- (soon) Support for Luarocks dependencies
- Expressive configuration and lazy-loading options
- Automatically compiles efficient lazy-loading code to improve startup time
- Uses native packages
- Extensible
- Written in Lua, configured in Lua
- Post-install/update hooks
- Uses jobs for async installation
- Support for `git` tags, branches, revisions, submodules
- Support for local plugins

==============================================================================
QUICKSTART                                       *packer-intro-quickstart*

To get started, first clone this repository to somewhere on your `packpath`, e.g.: >
  git clone https://github.com/wbthomason/packer.nvim\
   ~/.local/share/nvim/site/pack/packer/opt/packer.nvim


Then you can write your plugin specification in Lua, e.g. (in `~/.config/nvim/lua/plugins.lua`): >

  -- This file can be loaded by calling `lua require('plugins')` from your init.vim

  -- Only required if you have packer in your `opt` pack
  vim.cmd [[packadd packer.nvim]]
  -- Temporary until https://github.com/neovim/neovim/pull/12632 is merged
  vim._update_package_paths()

  return require('packer').startup(function()
    -- Packer can manage itself as an optional plugin
    use {'wbthomason/packer.nvim', opt = true}

    -- Simple plugins can be specified as strings
    use '9mm/vim-closer'

    -- Lazy loading:
    -- Load on specific commands
    use {'tpope/vim-dispatch', opt = true, cmd = {'Dispatch', 'Make', 'Focus', 'Start'}}

    -- Load on an autocommand event
    use {'andymass/vim-matchup', event = 'VimEnter *'}

    -- Load on a combination of conditions: specific filetypes or commands
    -- Also run code after load (see the "config" key)
    use {
      'w0rp/ale',
      ft = {'sh', 'zsh', 'bash', 'c', 'cpp', 'cmake', 'html', 'markdown', 'racket', 'vim', 'tex'},
      cmd = 'ALEEnable',
      config = 'vim.cmd[[ALEEnable]]
    }

    -- Plugins can have dependencies on other plugins
    use {
      'haorenW1025/completion-nvim',
      opt = true,
      requires = {{'hrsh7th/vim-vsnip', opt = true}, {'hrsh7th/vim-vsnip-integ', opt = true}}
    }

    -- Local plugins can be included
    use '~/projects/personal/hover.nvim'

    -- Plugins can have post-install/update hooks
    use {'iamcco/markdown-preview.nvim', run = 'cd app && yarn install', cmd = 'MarkdownPreview'}

    -- You can specify multiple plugins in a single call
    use {'tjdevries/colorbuddy.vim', {'nvim-treesitter/nvim-treesitter', opt = true}}
  end)

`packer` provides the following commands after you've run and configured `packer` with `require('packer').startup(...)`: *packer-default-commands* *packer-commands*

`PackerCompile`                                 *packer-commands-compile*
You must run this whenever you make changes to your plugin configuration.

`PackerInstall`                                 *packer-commands-install*
Install any missing plugins.

`PackerUpdate`                                  *packer-commands-update*
Update and install plugins.

`PackerClean`                                   *packer-commands-clean*
Remove any disabled or unused plugins.

`PackerSync`                                    *packer-commands-sync*
Perform `PackerClean` and then `PackerUpdate`.

==============================================================================
USAGE                                          *packer-usage*

Although the example in |packer-intro-quickstart| will be enough to get you
going for basic usage, `packer` has a number of other features and options
detailed in this section.

STARTUP                                        *packer-startup*

The easiest way to use `packer` is via the |packer.startup()| function. In
short, `startup` is a convenience function for simple setup, and is invoked as
`packer.startup(spec)`, where:

- `spec` can be a function: >
  packer.startup(function() use 'tjdevries/colorbuddy.vim' end)
- `spec` can be a table with a function as its first element and config
  overrides as another element: >
  packer.startup({
    function() use 'tjdevries/colorbuddy.vim' end, config = { ... }
    })
- `spec` can be a table with a table of plugin specifications as its first
  element and config overrides as another element: >
  packer.startup({{'tjdevries/colorbuddy.vim'}, config = { ... }})

See |packer-configuration| for the allowed configuration keys.

`startup` will handle calling |packer.init()| and |packer.reset()| for you, as
well as creating the commands given in |packer-commands|.

CUSTOM INITIALIZATION                          *packer-custom-initialization*
If you prefer a more manual setup with finer control over configuration and
loading, you may use custom initialization for `packer`. This approach has the
benefit of not requiring that the `packer` plugin be loaded unless you want to
perform plugin management operations, but it is more involved to use.

To take this approach, load `packer` like any other Lua module. You must call
|packer.init()| before performing any operations; it is recommended to call
|packer.reset()| if you may be re-running your specification code (e.g. by
sourcing your plugin specification file with `luafile`).

See |packer.init()| for more details on initialization; in short, `init` takes
a table of configuration values like that which can be passed to `startup`.

If you use custom initialization, you'll probably want to define commands to
load `packer` and perform common package management operations. The following
commands work well for this purpose: >

  command! PackerInstall packadd packer.nvim | lua require('plugins').install()
  command! PackerUpdate packadd packer.nvim | lua require('plugins').update()
  command! PackerSync packadd packer.nvim | lua require('plugins').sync()
  command! PackerClean packadd packer.nvim | lua require('plugins').clean()
  command! PackerCompile packadd packer.nvim | lua require('plugins').compile('~/.config/nvim/plugin/packer_load.vim')

CONFIGURATION                                  *packer-configuration*
`packer` provides the following configuration variables, presented in the
structure of the `config` table expected by `startup` or `init`, with their
default values: >
  {
    ensure_dependencies   = true, -- Should packer install plugin dependencies?
    package_root   = util.is_windows and '~\\AppData\\Local\\nvim-data\\site\\pack' or '~/.local/share/nvim/site/pack',
    compile_path = vim.fn.stdpath('config') .. '/plugin/packer_compiled.vim',
    plugin_package = 'packer', -- The default package for plugins
    max_jobs = nil, -- Limit the number of simultaneous jobs. nil means no limit
    auto_clean = true, -- During sync(), remove unused plugins
    disable_commands = false, -- During `startup`, disable creating commands
    git = {
      cmd = 'git', -- The base command for git operations
      subcommands = { -- Format strings for git subcommands
        update         = '-C %s pull --ff-only --progress --rebase=false',
        install        = 'clone %s %s --depth %i --no-single-branch --progress',
        fetch          = '-C %s fetch --depth 999999 --progress',
        checkout       = '-C %s checkout %s --',
        update_branch  = '-C %s merge --ff-only @{u}',
        current_branch = '-C %s branch --show-current',
        diff           = '-C %s log --color=never --pretty=format:FMT --no-show-signature HEAD@{1}...HEAD',
        diff_fmt       = '%%h %%s (%%cr)',
        get_rev        = '-C %s rev-parse --short HEAD',
        get_msg        = '-C %s log --color=never --pretty=format:FMT --no-show-signature HEAD -n 1',
        submodules     = '-C %s submodule update --init --recursive --progress'
      },
      depth = 1, -- Git clone depth
    },
    display = {
      open_fn  = nil, -- An optional function to open a window for packer's display
      open_cmd = '65vnew [packer]', -- An optional command to open a window for packer's display
      working_sym = '⟳', -- The symbol for a plugin being installed/updated
      error_sym = '✗', -- The symbol for a plugin with an error in installation/updating
      done_sym = '✓', -- The symbol for a plugin which has completed installation/updating
      removed_sym = '-', -- The symbol for an unused plugin which was removed
      moved_sym = '→', -- The symbol for a plugin which was moved (e.g. from opt to start)
      header_sym = '━', -- The symbol for the header line in packer's display
    }
  }

SPECIFYING PLUGINS                             *packer-specifying-plugins*
`packer` is based around declarative specification of plugins. You can declare
a plugin using the function |packer.use()|, which I highly recommend locally
binding to `use` for conciseness.

`use` takes either a string or a table. If a string is provided, it is treated
as a plugin location for a non-optional plugin with no additional
configuration. Plugin locations may be specified as:
  1. Absolute paths to a local plugin
  2. Full URLs (treated as plugins managed with `git`)
  3. `username/repo` paths (treated as Github `git` plugins)

A table given to `use` can take two forms:
  1. A list of plugin specifications (strings or tables)
  2. A table specifying a single plugin. It must have a plugin location string
  as its first element, and may additionally have a number of optional keyword
  elements, detailed in |packer.use()|

CONFIGURING PLUGINS                            *packer-plugin-configuration*
`packer` allows you to configure plugins either before they are loaded (the
`setup` key described in |packer.use()|) or after they are loaded (the
`config` key described in |packer.use()|).

CUSTOM INSTALLERS                              *packer-custom-installers*
You may specify a custom installer & updater for a plugin using the
`installer` and `updater` keys in a plugin specification. Note that either
both or none of these keys are required. These keys should be functions which
take as an argument a `display` object (from `lua/packer/display.lua`) and
return an async function (per `lua/packer/async.lua`) which (respectively)
installs/updates the given plugin.

Providing the `installer`/`updater` keys overrides plugin type detection, but
you still need to provide a location string for the name of the plugin.

POST-UPDATE HOOKS                              *packer-plugin-hooks* 
You may specify operations to be run after successful installs/updates of a
plugin with the `run` key in a plugin specification. This key may either be a
Lua function, which will be called with the `plugin` table for this plugin
(containing the information passed to |packer.use()| as well as output from
the installation/update commands, the installation path of the plugin, etc.),
or a string.

DEPENDENCIES                                   *packer-plugin-dependencies*
Plugins may specify dependencies via the `requires` key in their specification
table. This key can be a string or a list (table).

If `requires` is a string, it is treated as specifying a single plugin. If a
plugin with the name given in `requires` is already known in the managed set,
nothing happens. Otherwise, the string is treated as a plugin location string
and the corresponding plugin is added to the managed set.

If `requires` is a list, it is treated as a list of plugin specifications
following the format given above.

If `ensure_dependencies` is true, the plugins specified in `requires` will be
installed.

Plugins specified in `requires` are removed when no active plugins require
them.

KEYBINDINGS                                    *packer-plugin-keybindings*
Plugins may be lazy-loaded on the use of keybindings/maps. Individual
keybindings are specified under the `keys` key in a plugin specification
either as a string (in which case they are treated as normal mode maps) or a
table in the format `{mode, map}`.

LAZY-LOADING                                   *packer-lazy-load*
To optimize startup time, `packer.nvim` compiles code to perform the
lazy-loading operations you specify. This means that you do not need to load
`packer.nvim` unless you want to perform some plugin management operations.

To generate the compiled code, call `packer.compile(path)`, where `path` is
some file path on your `runtimepath`, with a `.vim` extension. This will
generate a blend of Lua and Vimscript to load and configure all your
lazy-loaded plugins (e.g. generating commands, autocommands, etc.) and save it
to `path`. Then, when you start vim, the file at `path` is loaded (because
`path` must be on your `runtimepath`), and lazy-loading works.

If `path` is not provided to |packer.compile()|, the output file will default
to the value of `config.compile_path`.

Note that you **must** run `packer.compile` yourself to generate this file.

EXTENDING PACKER                               *packer-extending*
You can add custom key handlers to `packer` by calling
`packer.set_handler(name, func)` where `name` is the key you wish to handle
and `func` is a function with the signature `func(plugins, plugin, value)`
where `plugins` is the global table of managed plugins, `plugin` is the table
for a specific plugin, and `value` is the value associated with key `name` in
`plugin`.

==============================================================================
API                                            *packer-api*

clean()		                                     *packer.clean()*
`clean` scans for and removes all disabled or no longer managed plugins. It is
invoked without arguments.

compile()		                                   *packer.compile()*
`compile` builds lazy-loader code from your plugin specification and saves it
to either `config.compile_path` if it is invoked with no argument, or to the
path it is invoked with if it is given a single argument. This path should end
in `.vim` and be on your |runtimepath| in order for lazy-loading to work. You
**must** call `compile` to update lazy-loaders after your configuration
changes.

init()		                                     *packer.init()*
Initializes `packer`; must be called before any calls to any other `packer`
function. Takes an optional table of configuration values as described in
|packer-configuration|.

install()		                                   *packer.install()*
`install` installs any missing plugins, runs post-update hooks, and updates
rplugins (|remote-plugin|) and helptags.

It can be invoked with no arguments or with a list of plugin names to install.
These plugin names must already be managed by `packer` via a call to
|packer.use()|.

reset()		                                     *packer.reset()*
`reset` empties the set of managed plugins. Called with no arguments; used to
ensure plugin specifications are reinitialized if the specification file is
reloaded. Called by |packer.startup()| or manually before calling
|packer.use()|.

set_handler()		                               *packer.set_handler()*
`set_handler` allows custom extension of `packer`. See |packer-extending| for
details.

startup()		                                   *packer.startup()*
`startup` is a convenience function for simple setup. See |packer-startup| for
details.

sync()		                                     *packer.sync()*
`sync` runs |packer.clean()| followed by |packer.update()|.

update()		                                   *packer.update()*
`update` installs any missing plugins, updates all installed plugins, runs
post-update hooks, and updates rplugins (|remote-plugin|) and helptags.

It can be invoked with no arguments or with a list of plugin names to update.
These plugin names must already be managed by `packer` via a call to
|packer.use()|.

use()		                                       *packer.use()*
`use` allows you to add one or more plugins to the managed set. It can be
invoked as follows:
- With a single plugin location string, e.g. `use <STRING>`
- With a single plugin specification table, e.g. >
  use {
    'myusername/example',   -- The plugin location string
    -- The following keys are all optional
    disable = boolean,           -- Mark a plugin as inactive
    installer = function,        -- Specifies custom installer. See "custom installers" below.
    updater = function,          -- Specifies custom updater. See "custom installers" below.
    after = string or list,      -- Specifies plugins to load before this plugin.
    rtp = string,                -- Specifies a subdirectory of the plugin to add to runtimepath.
    opt = boolean,               -- Manually marks a plugin as optional.
    branch = string,             -- Specifies a git branch to use
    tag = string,                -- Specifies a git tag to use
    commit = string,             -- Specifies a git commit to use
    run = string or function,    -- Post-update/install hook. See "update/install hooks".
    requires = string or list -- Specifies plugin dependencies. See "dependencies".
    config = string or function, -- Specifies code to run after this plugin is loaded.
    -- The following keys all imply lazy-loading
    cmd = string or list,        -- Specifies commands which load this plugin.
    ft = string or list,         -- Specifies filetypes which load this plugin.
    keys = string or list,       -- Specifies maps which load this plugin. See "Keybindings".
    event = string or list,      -- Specifies autocommand events which load this plugin.
    cond = string or function,   -- Specifies a conditional test to load this plugin
    setup = string or function,  -- Specifies code to run before this plugin is loaded.
  }
